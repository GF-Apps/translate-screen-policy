<h2>Terms & Conditions</h2>

<p>These Terms & Conditions apply to the Translate Screen Lite mobile application (hereinafter referred to as the "Application") developed by GF-Apps (hereinafter referred to as the "Service Provider") and provided as a Free service.</p>

<p>By downloading, installing, or using the Application, you agree to be bound by these Terms. If you do not agree, please do not use the Application.</p>

<h3>1. Application Functionality</h3>

<p>The Application provides on-screen text recognition and translation features.</p>

<p>The Application attempts to detect and translate on-screen text automatically. However, translation accuracy and detection coverage may vary depending on screen content, language, font, or application limitations. Users may also choose to translate selected portions of text.</p>

<h3>2. Required Permissions</h3>

<p>To function properly, the Application requires:</p>

<ul>
  <li><strong>Accessibility Service Permission</strong> – used strictly to detect and read on-screen text for translation purposes.</li>
  <li><strong>Display Over Other Apps (Overlay) Permission</strong> – used to display translated content on top of other applications.</li>
</ul>

<p>If these permissions are disabled, translation features will not function.</p>

<p>Users can enable or disable these permissions at any time through their device settings.</p>

<h3>3. Google ML Kit (On-Device Processing)</h3>

<p>The Application uses Google ML Kit for on-device text recognition and translation.</p>

<p>All text recognition and translation processes occur locally on the user's device (offline). The Application does not send recognized text to external servers.</p>

<p>An internet connection may be required only for downloading language models. After download, translations work offline.</p>

<h3>4. No Data Collection</h3>

<p>The Application does not collect, store, transmit, or share any personal data or user content.</p>

<h3>5. Disclaimer of Liability</h3>

<p>The translation results are provided automatically by machine learning technology and may not always be accurate, complete, or contextually correct.</p>

<p>The Service Provider is not responsible for any misunderstandings, losses, damages, or consequences resulting from the use of translated content.</p>

<p>The Application does not modify original content on the user's device. It only displays translated text visually.</p>

<h3>6. Internet & Charges</h3>

<p>Some features (such as language model downloads) may require an internet connection. The Service Provider is not responsible for any mobile data charges incurred.</p>

<h3>7. Device Responsibility</h3>

<p>You are responsible for maintaining the security of your device. The Service Provider advises against jailbreaking or rooting your device, as this may cause the Application to malfunction or become insecure.</p>

<h3>8. Intellectual Property</h3>

<p>All intellectual property rights related to the Application remain the property of the Service Provider. Unauthorized copying, modification, reverse engineering, or redistribution is prohibited.</p>

<h3>9. Updates & Termination</h3>

<p>The Service Provider may update or modify the Application at any time to improve functionality or comply with legal requirements.</p>

<p>The Service Provider may discontinue the Application at any time without prior notice.</p>

<p>Continued use of the Application after updates constitutes acceptance of the revised Terms.</p>

<h3>10. Changes to These Terms</h3>

<p>These Terms & Conditions may be updated from time to time. Updates will be posted on this page with a revised effective date.</p>

<p>Effective Date: 2026-02-20</p>
