<h2>Privacy Policy</h2>

<p>This Privacy Policy applies to the Translate Screen Lite mobile application (hereinafter referred to as the "Application") developed by GF-Apps (hereinafter referred to as the "Service Provider").</p>

<p>The Application is provided as a Free service and is intended for use "AS IS".</p>

<h3>1. No Personal Data Collection</h3>

<p>The Application does not collect, store, transmit, sell, or share any personal data or user content.</p>

<p>The Application does not require account registration and does not use analytics, tracking technologies, or advertising identifiers.</p>

<h3>2. Accessibility & Overlay Permissions</h3>

<p>The Application requires the following permissions to function:</p>

<ul>
  <li><strong>Accessibility Service Permission</strong> – used solely to detect and read on-screen text for translation purposes.</li>
  <li><strong>Display Over Other Apps (Overlay) Permission</strong> – used to display translated text visually over other applications.</li>
</ul>

<p>The Accessibility Service is strictly used to analyze visible on-screen text in order to provide translation functionality.</p>

<p>No text, content, or personal data accessed through Accessibility is stored, recorded, transmitted, or shared.</p>

<p>Users may enable or disable these permissions at any time via device settings. If disabled, translation features will not function.</p>

<h3>3. On-Device Processing (Google ML Kit)</h3>

<p>The Application uses Google ML Kit for text recognition and translation.</p>

<p>All text recognition and translation processes occur locally on the user's device (offline).</p>

<p>The Application does not send recognized text or translated content to external servers.</p>

<p>An internet connection may be required only for downloading language models. Once downloaded, translation works offline.</p>

<h3>4. Internet Usage</h3>

<p>The Application may temporarily access the internet solely for downloading language models required for offline translation.</p>

<p>No user content is transmitted during translation.</p>

<h3>5. Location Information</h3>

<p>The Application does not collect precise or approximate location information.</p>

<h3>6. Third-Party Services</h3>

<p>The Application does not use third-party analytics, advertising, or tracking services.</p>

<h3>7. Children's Privacy</h3>

<p>The Application does not knowingly collect personal information from children under the age of 13.</p>

<p>Since no personal data is collected, there is minimal risk to children's privacy.</p>

<h3>8. Data Security</h3>

<p>Because the Application does not collect or store personal data, there is no database of user information that could be accessed or breached.</p>
